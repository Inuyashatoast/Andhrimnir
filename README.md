This application is designed as a food delivery service intended for use within an organization. 
Users can specify what they wish to order from various restaurants. The admin has the capability to manage users, restaurants, and food items available at those restaurants. 
Additionally, the admin can determine which orders should be accepted for delivery and which should not.

Please note that integration with a payment system is not intended at this time.
